# Boot Camp Web Design Project

## Description

The purpose of this web design project was to attain a rudimentary grasp of the process of handling the front-end component of software utilization. 

I have always wanted to get an understanding of the ins and outs of the web developer world, and perhaps I can use my initial knowledge gained from this class to parlay that into a fruitful career in computer programming.

I participated in this project in order to test myself and see if I could overcome the frustration of having to fix my own errors as well as those of the assignment.

I feel the project addresses the fluidity and appeal of websites for the end users.  HTML is the framework unseen, CSS provides pizzazz, and JavaScript provides interaction between website and the consumer. Git and GitHub makes it all possible.

I have realized that I have potential in this crazy field of work.

## Usage

The project allows the end user to navigate through the different fields covered by the boot camp program.

Firstly, there is HTML, which is the foundation of the website. Users can understand head and body elements as they weave through the coding in Git and Visual Studio Code.  Secondly, there is CSS, and with the coding, the user can add color and design modifications to dialog boxes.  Git functions like the old MS-DOS.  Users will be able to go back and forth through different directories and folders and both push and pull information to and from both branches and the m,ain directory.  With JavaScript, users can learn how to streamline tedious and monotonous code into easy-to-use functions in order to have a smooth web program.  With JS, you will create a structured and easy flowing problem with the aid of DevTools.
